# Illumin8---Kids-Checkin-App
A Xamarin.iOS app for managing the checkin and checkout of kids into safe environments. The mobile devices each have an instance of SQLite which are replicated to a Zumero Server with a SQL backend.

The app manages the printing (via web service - will include project if anyone wants it) of barcode labels with a few details and a QR code. This label is attached to the shirt of the child and they are scanned in using the app as well. A parent label is also printed. 

The app timestamps each entrance and exit of each child and also records which environment they went into.
