    Zumero Client SDK License Agreement

    IMPORTANT - READ CAREFULLY.

    This License Agreement (“Agreement”) is a legal agreement between you (either
    an individual or a single entity) and Zumero LLC (“Zumero”) for the software
    product identified above which includes computer software (together with any
    updates or upgrades provided to you by Zumero) and online or electronic
    documentation and may include associated media and printed materials (“SDK”).
    By installing, copying, or otherwise using the SDK, you agree to be bound by
    the terms of this Agreement. If you do not agree to the terms of this
    Agreement, do not install or use the SDK.

    The SDK is protected by copyright laws and international copyright treaties, as
    well as other intellectual property laws and treaties. The SDK is licensed, not
    sold.

    1. GRANT OF LICENSE

    Zumero grants to you a limited, non-transferable, non-exclusive right to
    install and use one copy of the SDK solely for the following purposes:

    a. You may use the SDK for the development of a software application (“Licensee
    Application(s)”) that incorporates Zumero’s proprietary software contained in
    the SDK and that is to be used in conjunction with a Zumero Server.

    b. You may sell, license, and distribute any and all Licensee Applications that
    incorporate compiled elements of the SDK.

    Zumero reserves all rights not expressly granted to you. 

    2. COPYRIGHT

    All rights, title, and copyrights in and to the SDK (including, but not limited
    to, any images, photographs, animations, video, audio, music, text, and
    "applets" incorporated into the SDK) and any copies of the SDK are owned by
    Zumero LLC or its suppliers. The SDK is protected by copyright laws and
    international treaty provisions. Therefore, you must treat the SDK like any
    other copyrighted material, except that you may make one copy of the SDK solely
    for backup or archival purposes. You may not copy the printed materials
    accompanying the SDK.

    3. DESCRIPTION OF OTHER RIGHTS AND LIMITATIONS

    a. Except as expressly stated herein, you may not modify, adapt, reverse
    engineer, decompile, disassemble, rent, lease, transfer, sublicense, sell,
    assign or distribute the SDK or any part thereof.

    b. Without prejudice to any other rights, Zumero may terminate this Agreement
    if you fail to comply with the terms and conditions of this Agreement. In such
    event, you must cease use of the SDK and destroy all copies of the SDK and all
    of its component parts.

    4. EXPORT RESTRICTIONS

    You agree that neither you nor your customers intend to or will, directly or
    indirectly, export or transmit (a) the SDK or related documentation and
    technical data, or (b) Licensee Application as described in this Agreement (or
    any part thereof), or process, or service that is the direct product of the SDK
    to any country to which such export or transmission is restricted by any
    applicable U.S. regulation or statute, without the prior written consent, if
    required, of the Bureau of Export Administration of the U.S. Department of
    Commerce, or such other governmental entity as may have jurisdiction over such
    export or transmission.

    5. U.S. GOVERNMENT RESTRICTED RIGHTS

    The SDK and documentation are provided with RESTRICTED RIGHTS. Use,
    duplication, or disclosure by the Government is subject to restrictions as set
    forth in subparagraph (c)(1)(ii) of The Rights in Technical Data and Computer
    Software clause at DFARS 252.227-7013 or subparagraphs (c)(1) and (2) of the
    Commercial Computer Software - Restricted Rights at 48 CFR 52.227-19, as
    applicable.

    6. INDEMNIFICATION

    You shall defend, indemnify and hold harmless Zumero, its officers, directors
    and employees, from and against any claims, suits, proceedings or threats
    thereof and any losses, damages, fines, expenses (including but not limited to
    attorneys’ fees and costs), judgments, awards, or other liabilities or damages
    (a) arising out of or relating to any claims that your use or distribution of
    the SDK in conjunction with any Licensee Application infringes, violates or
    misappropriates any IPR of any third party, or (b) resulting from any breach of
    this Agreement by you.

    7. GENERAL

    a. This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of Illinois. Should you
    have any questions concerning this Agreement, or if you desire to contact
    Zumero for any reason, please access our website at http://www.zumero.com or
    contact us at support@zumero.com.

    b. NO WARRANTIES. To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, Zumero
    expressly disclaims any warranty for the SDK. The SDK and any related
    documentation are provided "as is" without warranty of any kind, either express
    or implied, including, without limitation, the implied warranties of
    merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose. The entire risk arising
    out of use or performance of the SDK remains with you.

    c. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. Zumero’s entire liability and your exclusive
    remedy under this Agreement shall not exceed five dollars (US $5.00).

    d. NO LIABILITY FOR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES. To the maximum extent permitted by
    applicable law, in no event shall Zumero or its suppliers be liable for any
    damages whatsoever (including, without limitation, damages for loss of business
    profit, business interruption, loss of business information, or any other
    pecuniary loss) arising out of the use of, or inability to use, the SDK, even
    if Zumero has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

    e. MODIFICATION. This Agreement may not be modified except in a writing duly
    signed by you and an authorized representative of Zumero.

    f. NO ASSIGNMENT. Your rights and obligations under this Agreement shall not be
    assignable, delegable, sub-licensable or otherwise transferable, whether
    voluntarily, by operation of law or otherwise, without Zumero’s prior written
    approval. Zumero may freely assign this Agreement and/or its rights and
    obligations hereunder.

    g. SEVERABILITY. If any provision of this Agreement is held to be unenforceable
    for any reason, the remaining provisions hereof shall be unaffected and shall
    remain in full force and effect.

    h. NOTICES. Any notices shall be in writing and in the English language and
    will be deemed to have been given if delivered personally or mailed by
    registered air mail postage prepaid to the respective addresses of each party.

    i. ENTIRE AGREEMENT. This Agreement contains the entire understanding of the
    parties with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement and merges and
    supersedes all prior and contemporaneous agreements and understandings between
    the parties, whether oral or written, with respect to the subject matter of
    this Agreement.

     LICENSE ISSUES
      ==============

      The OpenSSL toolkit stays under a dual license, i.e. both the conditions of
      the OpenSSL License and the original SSLeay license apply to the toolkit.
      See below for the actual license texts. Actually both licenses are BSD-style
      Open Source licenses. In case of any license issues related to OpenSSL
      please contact openssl-core@openssl.org.
